## Plan

Find out what the real meaning of the word success is. We can find out from webinars, articles, journals, books, and others. Being successful is a goal of our lives, success does not mean the end of our goals, success can also tell when we have completed an activity well it can also be said to be successful. to be successful does not have to be the same as other people, there are various ways to achieve success because everyone has their path to success.

## Final Statement

I don’t agree with that opinion because success is not only for talented people, everyone has their way to achieving success because success doesn’t mean we have to be people with high positions, rich or so. we can achieve success from simple things such as completing a course, buying something and so on. and everyone must have their talents and if we feel we don’t have a talent we can improve it by studying diligently or taking part in activities to increase our skills.
