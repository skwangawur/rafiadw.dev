Feedback is an important part of making us grow and be better than before. Giving Feedback can be positive or negative in how we give or receive feedback because everyone has their own emotional capacity. One good way to give and receive feedback is to look at the situation, behavior, and impact.

-   Situation. Describe the specific situation in which the behavior occurred.
-   Behavior. Describe the actual, observable behavior being discussed. Keep to the facts. â€¦
-   Impact. Describe the results of the behavior.

Everyone must have received feedback, and from the various feedbacks received there must be one feedback that will always be remembered. Here I will tell you one of the feedbacks that I always remember, even though the feedback was not given personally but as a team, namely when I prepared a presentation after entering the top 12 finalists. The feedback that I and my team received are:

If you want to do something (solve a problem) look at the root of the problem (basic) instead of making a solution right away. You are still young, you still have many other opportunities. This competition is not the end of your journey, you are still a race or other things that you can achieve. Becoming a winner is not the main goal of participating in activities such as times competitions, but what is the process you have gone through so that you can get to this point. Many out there life is just relaxing and you have done well so that you can get into the top 12 whatever later is not the end of everything.
